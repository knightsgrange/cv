          I am now retired, but I have had several interesting jobs throughout my life. After leaving school I joined an old family firm that built trucks, called Foden's. Here I served a Mechanical Engineering Apprenticeship and obtained my City & Guilds 'Mech
          Eng Tech' Certificates Part's I & II.
          <br>From there I spent several years in the Electronics Industry and obtained a Electronic Technicians Certificate.
          <br />Then I moved into Telecommunications for the next 20yrs.<br> The last 20 yrs was spent in Banking and Insurance after obtaining the CII FPC I, II & III.
